# 📊 AtliQ Hardware P&L Report (Codebasics Bootcamp Project)

This repository contains my Excel-based **Profit & Loss (P&L) Report** project for **AtliQ Hardware**, completed as part of the **Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases how to prepare an end-to-end P&L report using **Microsoft Excel**, pivot tables, and dynamic slicers. The report provides:

- **P&L by Fiscal Years**
  - Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Margin, and Gross Margin % (GM%) for FY 2019, 2020, and 2021.
  - Year-over-Year comparison (`21 vs 20`).
  - Dynamic filters: region, market, customer, and division.

- **P&L by Month/Quarter**
  - Detailed breakdown by quarters for each fiscal year.
  - Organized into pivot tables with clean formatting.

Screenshots are included for a quick preview.
